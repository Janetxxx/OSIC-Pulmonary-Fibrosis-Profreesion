# OSIC-Pulmonary-Fibrosis-Profreesion
Kaggle project <br>

Utilise machine learning technique to predict the patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on the CT scan of their lungs (OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression | Kaggle, 2020). All the data used in this project can be found in the competition data section. The lung function can be reflected by the forced vital capacity (FVC) which measures the volume of air exhaled. Associated clinical information such as age, gender, smoking status and an entire history of FVC measurement will be provided to support the prediction. The basic approach starts with analysing and pre-processing the clinical data in order to find the best feature to predict the FVC measurement in the upcoming weeks. The CT scan for each patient will also be analysed slice by slice and any information correlated with the FVC measurement will be extracted. Finally, different machine learning algorithms will be trained and evaluated based on their performance score.<br>

The motivation of this project is to improve the quality of information communicated to the patients and their carers and hence help them understand the prognosis better. A reliable prediction of disease progression will also enable the earlier identification of complications such as pulmonary hypertension and heart failure and help with deciding an appropriate time for lung transplant operation.
